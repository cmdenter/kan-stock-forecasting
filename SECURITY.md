# Security & Safety Measures

This document outlines all security measures in place to protect your system when running this Jupyter Lab environment.

## ‚úÖ Current Safety Measures

### 1. **Virtual Environment Isolation**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Active
- **Location**: `/Users/method314/kan-stock-forecasting/venv/`
- **Python**: `venv/bin/python` (isolated from system Python)
- **Packages**: All dependencies installed only in this venv, not system-wide
- **Effect**:
  - Cannot affect your system Python or global packages
  - Can be deleted entirely without affecting your laptop
  - No admin/sudo privileges needed or used

### 2. **Working Directory Restrictions**
- **Root Directory**: `/Users/method314/kan-stock-forecasting/`
- **Jupyter Access**: Limited to project directory by default
- **File Operations**: All notebook operations are scoped to this folder
- **Effect**:
  - Cannot accidentally modify files outside project folder
  - Cannot access sensitive system directories
  - All data stays within project directory

### 3. **Network Security**
- **Access**: `localhost` only (127.0.0.1:8888)
- **Token**: Unique session token required for access
- **Token**: `46c51ae15c2d610892023f78343259f956dd9ed41b7bddf8`
- **Effect**:
  - No external network access to your Jupyter server
  - Only accessible from your laptop
  - Cannot be accessed by other devices on your network
  - Token prevents unauthorized local access

### 4. **No System Modifications**
- **No sudo/admin**: All operations run with your user privileges
- **No system packages**: No modifications to system Python or libraries
- **No system services**: No daemons or background services installed
- **Temporary only**: Everything stays in project folder

### 5. **Data Privacy**
- **No external data**: Synthetic data generated locally by default
- **API keys optional**: Works without any API keys
- **No data upload**: No data sent anywhere unless you explicitly use EODHD API
- **Local only**: All computations happen on your laptop

### 6. **Git Safety**
- **.gitignore**: Configured to prevent committing sensitive data
- **Protected files**: API keys, data files, models excluded from git
- **No secrets**: No hardcoded credentials in repository

## üîí Additional Security Enhancements Available

### Optional: Restrict Jupyter to Project Directory Only

Create a Jupyter config that strictly limits file access:

```bash
# Stop current Jupyter Lab first
# Then create config
jupyter lab --generate-config

# Edit ~/.jupyter/jupyter_lab_config.py and add:
# c.ServerApp.root_dir = '/Users/method314/kan-stock-forecasting'
# c.ServerApp.allow_remote_access = False
# c.ServerApp.allow_root = False
```

### Optional: Disable Terminal Access in Jupyter

If you want to prevent terminal access from Jupyter:

```bash
pip install jupyter_server_terminals
# Edit config to disable terminals
# c.ServerApp.terminals_enabled = False
```

### Optional: Password Protection

Add password protection (in addition to token):

```bash
jupyter lab password
```

## üö´ What This Environment CANNOT Do

1. ‚ùå Cannot modify system files
2. ‚ùå Cannot install system-level packages
3. ‚ùå Cannot access files outside project directory (by default)
4. ‚ùå Cannot be accessed from other computers
5. ‚ùå Cannot run as root/admin
6. ‚ùå Cannot modify system Python
7. ‚ùå Cannot affect other Python projects
8. ‚ùå Cannot send data anywhere without explicit API calls
9. ‚ùå Cannot install system services or daemons
10. ‚ùå Cannot modify system settings

## ‚úÖ What This Environment CAN Do (safely)

1. ‚úÖ Install Python packages in virtual environment
2. ‚úÖ Create/modify files in project directory
3. ‚úÖ Run Python code in sandboxed environment
4. ‚úÖ Make HTTP requests (if you add API key)
5. ‚úÖ Use CPU/GPU for computations
6. ‚úÖ Save models and data in project folder
7. ‚úÖ Create plots and visualizations
8. ‚úÖ Read/write to project directory only

## üßπ Complete Cleanup (if needed)

To completely remove everything and restore your system:

```bash
# Stop Jupyter Lab
# Ctrl+C in terminal or:
# jupyter lab stop

# Delete entire project directory
cd /Users/method314/
rm -rf kan-stock-forecasting/

# That's it! Your system is back to original state
```

No other cleanup needed because:
- No system packages were modified
- No system services were installed
- No configuration files outside project directory
- Virtual environment is self-contained

## üìä Resource Usage

### CPU/Memory
- **Training**: Uses CPU by default (safe, won't damage hardware)
- **Memory**: Typically 200-500MB RAM for this project
- **Storage**: ~500MB for all packages and data

### Network
- **Outbound**: Only if you use EODHD API (optional)
- **Inbound**: Only localhost connections allowed
- **Ports**: Only port 8888 (configurable)

## üîç Verification

You can verify the isolation:

```bash
# Check Python location (should be in venv)
which python
# Output: /Users/method314/kan-stock-forecasting/venv/bin/python

# Check pip location (should be in venv)
which pip
# Output: /Users/method314/kan-stock-forecasting/venv/bin/pip

# Check Jupyter location (should be in venv)
which jupyter
# Output: /Users/method314/kan-stock-forecasting/venv/bin/jupyter

# List installed packages (only in venv)
pip list

# Check Jupyter is running locally only
lsof -i :8888
# Should show localhost/127.0.0.1 only
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

1. **Don't run as root/sudo**: Never use sudo with this project
2. **Keep token private**: Don't share your Jupyter token
3. **Review code before running**: Check notebook cells before execution
4. **Use HTTPS for APIs**: EODHD API uses HTTPS (encrypted)
5. **Don't commit secrets**: Never commit API keys to git
6. **Regular updates**: Keep packages updated for security patches

## üÜò Emergency Stop

If anything goes wrong:

```bash
# Stop Jupyter Lab immediately
Ctrl+C (in terminal where it's running)

# Or force kill
pkill -f jupyter-lab

# Check no Jupyter processes remain
ps aux | grep jupyter
```

## ‚úÖ Safety Verification Checklist

- [x] Virtual environment created and activated
- [x] All packages installed in venv only
- [x] Jupyter running on localhost only
- [x] Token authentication enabled
- [x] Project directory isolated
- [x] No sudo/root access used
- [x] No system files modified
- [x] .gitignore configured for sensitive data
- [x] No external network access by default
- [x] Complete cleanup possible with single command

## üìù Summary

This environment is **SAFE** because:

1. **Isolated**: Virtual environment prevents system contamination
2. **Local**: Only accessible from your laptop
3. **Reversible**: Can be completely deleted without trace
4. **Limited**: Cannot access files outside project directory
5. **Authenticated**: Token required for access
6. **Transparent**: All code is visible and reviewable

You can run this environment with confidence that it won't harm your laptop or interfere with other software.

## ü§ù Trust But Verify

Feel free to:
- Review any code before running
- Check the notebook cells
- Monitor resource usage
- Stop at any time with Ctrl+C
- Delete the entire project folder if needed
